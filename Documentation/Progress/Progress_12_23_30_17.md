# Progress for 12/23/17 - 12/30/17

Tons of work was done on the backend with `Amazon Web Services`. Complete integration of user information was added so users can now be created that will now be stored in `AWS Cognito` and `AWS S3`. Study Hour functionality was implemnted for the most part. Signatures and location confirmation at the end of the study session needs to be added, but everything else was implemented. Study Hours keeps it's data in `AWS DynamoDB`. Parts of the user interface had to be redesigned (primarily the side menus) because previous libraries did not have proper support for multiple modal views. Core Data, Keychain, and FB were all removed as a result of implementing AWS.

## Side Menu Redesign

I had to redo the whole side menu because the previous library ([Side Menu](https://github.com/jonkykong/SideMenu)) did not have support for multiple `modal views` which I was completely incredulous about. It made no sense to not support this since that was the whole point of a side menu, is to go from one view to another. So I switched to [SWRevealViewController](https://github.com/John-Lluch/SWRevealViewController) which was a much better designed library that could take into account multiple modal views. It was a little hard to implement because it was written in `Objective C` instead of `Swift`, but there were some good tutorials online for it that helped. I really like it for the most part since it's really good at handling views, I just wish the side menu views were above the main view instead of below it, but it still looks pretty good.

## AWS Services

### Using AWS Cognito

I used `AWS Cognito` to get the following user information:

* First Name
* Last Name
* Profile Pic (URL) (Picture saved on `AWS S3`)
* Contact Email
* Phone Number
* Home Address
* Year
* Major
* Brothers Status (i.e. brother/pledge/neophyte)
* Pin Number
* Probation Level
* House Positions
* App Email (associated with app account and AWS)
* Username
* Password

This list took an **EXTREMELY** long time to implement. Every step of this was arduous. First I disabled all my previous code (`Core Data`, `Keychain Access`, `Touch ID`), so that was a little frustrating, cause I knew this was the first thing I should have implemented, but I couldn't find good documentation or examples at the time, so I skipped it. I ended up having to actually use some of amazon's example code and transfer my whole project over to theirs. So that's why I have two github repositories now. So that was a real pain. I could not find out for the life of me why I wasn't able to reach the server, cause I had like the exact same code as the example, so it ended up being easier just to move everything.

Then I had to send the data for all of these to `Cognito`. This was honestly just a lot of tedious coding. Especially for custom values (i.e. brother status, year, major, etc.). Not only was it a pain because I had to make them their own custom views, but also because I had to configure the security for them, which was **A LOT** harder than it should have been. Amazon either does not have good documentation/updated their website recently/or both, because it was really hard to find the security settings for my app. Not to mention that it's hard to tell how some of their services interconnect (for example, there is another service called  `IAM` which also controls permissions, so it was just very confusing getting the right permissions to the right app). I could go on for hours, but just know that AWS is a pain to work with.

The extraneous views for stuff like brother status (mentioned above) were really annoying to deal with. As I had to `segue` to one, then `unwind segue` to another (which I did not find out until I already implemented it improperly). So there was just a hard learning curve when dealing with the `navigation controller`. In the end it ended up being pretty simple, just making sure the data "remained" in the view controller was a bit tricky for me.

I also worked a lot on data validation and tried to make sure I was as clear as possible with how data should be input (since `AWS` needs it in a certain format). I let my mom sign up for a fake account and she could figure it out for the most part, so I figured my college colleagues could probably figure it out.

### Using AWS S3

`AWS S3` is the service I am using to store user photos. It's really just a server that you can use to store information in chunks they call `buckets`, which have `items` in them. So the profile pics will be the `items`. Then I made the `bucket` public so that I could easily access the url (security, again, was a royal pain). I am going to try to make it more secure later, but I figured it didn't need to be as secure as stuff like the username and password. 

### Using AWS DynamoDB

I used DynamoDB to store study hour information in an `Excel` type manner. It seems like a small scale server (which is just what I need) and I can easily search by attributes (like name and week). So it should theoretically make my job easier!

## Study Hours View

So the study hours view was the other primary thing I've been working on. I've implemented the following

### Probo Requirements Tab

This was simply a link to [this](https://github.com/jamesjweber/Beta-App/blob/master/Documentation/Probo%20Requirements.md) github page. It just has all the requirements for all probo levels. I thought the mark up would look better than anything I could do in with the app view. I added this using `WebKit View	` which was fairly easy to use!

### Set Location Tab

For this I used the system location along with the `Google Place Picker` to allow users to pick the location where they are studying. I have limitation on this so that users cannot pick locations where they are not at, but with the `Google Place Picker`, it allows them to pick the place they are at (which gives me a nice clean name). I spent a lot of time adjusting the distance to give it enough tolerance, but also tightening it just enough so that hopefluly any point in a typical college building is valid, but anywhere outside of it is invalid. 

### Set Class Tab

This tab just takes text as a `UIAlertInput`. It's basically just the class name

### Start/Stop Studying Tab

So when this button is cliked, if the location and class are set, it will start a timer. You can press the button again to stop it. It will record your time, and save your time as well as other information like you name, probo level, location, etc. This will make it easier for me to account for horus. I still need to validate location at the end (make sure they didn't move somewhere else), and get a signature.

### Study Log Tab

This still needs to be implmented, but should be pretty easy. It will be a table view of all the users study hours.

## Reflections

So I feel like I've learned a bit while doing this project, which I'd like to talk about here.

### Preperation

I think this project has taught me how important preperation is. I did plan out basic ideas for each of the app views the first day I started, but then I jumped into the app. This has led to many head banging moments for me. If had a cleared idea of what I wanted, I think I could have saved some time.

#### To be fair though...
This is my first time programming in Swift so I'm learning the language as I'm making it, so a lot of stuff is just hard to plan for because I don't know how to use it. 
 
### Working too hard

*I'm really not trying to sound douchy, I promise.* But, I've basically working on this project 24/7 for the whole break, so I'm pretty burnt out. So I've really learned that you can't just brute force everything. I think you probably do need to take breaks every now and then to do something else 

### Time (and Patience)

Good work only comes with time. This project is so frustrating to me because of how long everything is taking. Like today I was just trying to get my profile picture to upload to the `S3`. I think it took something like **6 hours** just to get a picture to upload. This is so incredibily frustrating to me because I *feel* like a feature like that should take like 30 mins to implement. However, since I'm new to lie everything, it just takes me exponentially longer. This is frustrating becasue I want to have an amazing app created within like 3 weeks, but I'm also realizing if you want quality, it really takes an incredible amount of time. So this whole thing has just been a... humbling? Yeah, humbling experience for me.
