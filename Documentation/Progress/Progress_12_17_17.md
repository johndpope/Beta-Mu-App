# Progress for 12/17/17

Today I got spent a lot of time messing around with the UI for the homescreen of the App. I refered a lot to the Udacity `Auto Layout`course that I mentioned yesterday. I was able to get a UI working for the homepage that accepted a `username` and `password` (which used the security dots ‚óè). The UI was able to save `username` and `password` into local variables. I also implemented `sign in` and `create account` buttons, which are not operational yet. They will take the user to different views depending on the input. I also created and added `graphics` for the app including the app icons. I taught myself how to use `Photoshop` so that I could make the app icons and background. I also looked into `Amazon Web Services` and created an account. I was not able to implement it today, but am planning on looking into it tomorrow.
