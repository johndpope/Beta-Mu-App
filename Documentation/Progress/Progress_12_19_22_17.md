# Progress for 12/19/17 - 12/22/17

Decided to focus on implementing app `UI` so that way I have the structure for the app. I used a lot of libraries using `CocoaPods`. This allowed me create a beautiful looking app that is loaded with excellent features and `security`. See all sections below for details on everything! 

## Libraries Added

* [`IQKeyboardManager`](https://github.com/hackiftekhar/IQKeyboardManager)

* [`TOCropViewController`](https://github.com/TimOliver/TOCropViewController)

* [`KeychainSwift`](https://github.com/evgenyneu/keychain-swift)

* [`SideMenu`](https://github.com/jonkykong/SideMenu)

### IQKeyboardManager

I used this library to fix the problem of the `keyboard covering text fields` lower on the screen. This is an **excellent** library and seamlessly moves the view for the keyboard!

### TOCropViewController

This library allowed me to `crop user pictures` once a picture was selected. This was necessary so that user images that were not square were not squished to fit the square constraints of the profile picture. Another gorgeous addon!

### Keychain 

See in `Security` below

### SideMenu

I used this to add custom side menus to my app. It was fairly straightforward to use. Allowed me to make sexy looking `semi-transpartent menus`.

## Security

I used many of `Apple`'s core libraries to make the app secure. I used `CoreData`, `LocalAuthentication`, and `Keychain`

### Core Data

Core Data is where I stored most of the user information. Whenever a user inputs text into a text field (such as first name or address), the data is stored into Core Data. This saves the information on the device permantently. This allowed me to save the state of each view if the user went back and forth betweeen the **Sign-In** page and **Create Account** page. I thought this would be a nice feature so that users would not lose progress if they accidentally left the **Create Account** page. The **Password** is **NOT SAVED** in core data. Instead it was saved in the `Keychain`. This means that the password fields get cleared when going between views. Also note that the `profile picture` is not saved in Core Data yet.

#### Facebook Data

Facebook data is partially implemented. I have it set up so that `Facebook` data is downloaded. However, it is not saved to `Core Data` yet. However, the profile picture is set to profile picture icon in the create account view is updated to the users `Facebook profile picture`. This is implemented using a `URL`, so the `Facebook profile picture` currently overrides any other image set. My implmentation of `Facebook` also uses push notification to ask user if they want to use `Facebook` to fill out some information in the **Create Account** view.

### Local Authentication

Local Authentication is used to implemented `Touch ID` (or `Face ID` if user has a compatible iPhone). Most of the code is taken from a Stack Overflow post. Currently the user can "log in" by clicking on the `Touch ID` icon. However, this is not currently linked to the username/password/user information. I still need to link this a user account. It also does not ask for user permission to use Touch ID for the app yet. It is still a really easy way to test the app as it takes me immediately to the Main screen. 

### Keychain

I am using the [`KeychainSwift`](https://github.com/evgenyneu/keychain-swift) library which gives very useful helper functions to save data in the Keychain. Currently only the password is saved in the keychain. The username will also be added at some time.



## UI Update Comments

I decided to change the background because it was really hard to find a color for the buttons that would look good with the weird pink/purple background, so it was just changed back to plain blue. Backgrounds were added for all buttons. These may be updated still, as I'm not sure if I like the look of them still. Changing the font may fix the issue. I also made a `scrolling view` for the **Create Account** screen. This allows for flexibilty in the future and allowed me to collect more information. I also added `error checking` for both the **Sign-In** and **Create Account Screens**. These print error messages if information is not properly entered. Finally, I implemented a `Navigation View` for the **Main** screen of the app. Currently it defaults to *Announcements*, which hasn't been implmented. There are also buttons in the navigation bar that open a side menu and settings, respectively. I custom made the buttons using `Adobe Photoshop` and `Illustrator` (2018). I decided to learn how to use those programs so that I avoided piracy, while making a really good looking UI. Each menu is implemented using a `Table View`. Each `Table View` uses a `custom implementation`. The **Settings** menu also has `Section Headers`. All of these views use `blur effects` that make the interface look really nice.
